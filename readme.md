The PTC can generate as many as needed test papers based on one original test paper written in Latex. In each generated test paper, the question order and quantities in questions can also be randomized, according to further commands in the form of PTC-* in the Latex file. 

For many test papers, corresponding answers should also be generated. If the test paper is only made of multiple-choice questions, all the answers will be generated "automatically", then no programming is needed. For computing questions, users can code but only the computing part for answers, in FORTRAN, C, or C++ language. While the PTC was orginally coded in FORTRAN, the C and C++ interfaces have been added recently. 

Since this is a combination of computing languages with Latex, extensive work can be done. In the 

      examples/example10.matrix.and.symbol.operations 
      
of FORTRAN/C/C++ languages, a matrix multiplication of mathematical symbols is presented. Of course, further mathematical operations can also be coded with this package.
