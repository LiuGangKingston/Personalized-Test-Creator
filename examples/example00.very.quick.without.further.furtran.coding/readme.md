      This is the first and very quick example of The Personalized Test Creator (PTC)


Supposing a teacher at a Canadian elementary school is testing 198 pupils, then wants to generate 198 copies of randomized test papers, based on her two questions. 
One is an addition of two two-digit integers. The other is a multiple-choice question to choose the correct numbers of provinces and territories in Canada. Then let us see how the papers are randomized. 


As the teacher can calculate the result of the first equation in heart immediately, she does not code any further FORTRAN code for any answer of the whole test. However, the answer to the multiple-choice question can still be generated "automatically", which does not need anybody to do further FORTRAN programming.
